Monday, Feb 25.  Some notes on discussions we had today.

The main points we are working on are:

Exercising MOSDEX in various ways.
• Stefan has started to code up GAMS->MOSDEX, for example.
• More of these sorts of translation activities will help us understand more about how the core concepts will behave in familiar environments.
• We also spoke about extending sources of data, for example, to streams
• We also spoke about using a base class for both variables and constraints (both are indexed data, for example)
• We also spoke about using a concept of "sets" as primary entities.

Thinking about composition and extensions.  We discussed the idea of "containers" as being a basic building block
• A single container might be a MOSDEX model that when coupled with data would be sufficient to send to a solver.
• But in a time-indexed problem, each time step can be thought of as a separate "container", where each pair of adjacent containers is linked by coupling constraints, like inventory balance.
• In which case, the solver might like to know that there is structure

Finally we spent some time discussing OSI.
• If MOSDEX can express attributes of matrices, constraints or variables, then perhaps solvers could be selected based on these attributes.
• And vice-versa: if solvers can handle certain attributes then perhaps they can advertise them in some form of description language (edited)
